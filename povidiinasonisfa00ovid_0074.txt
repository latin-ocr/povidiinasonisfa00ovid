103. υοοαόαηύ Chaos] The name J emus was thought
by some to be connected With χαίνεῑν ‘ to yawn.’ It
has been suggested by the present editor (Praef. ad
Prom. Vinct. p. xx.) that it. is connected with ιάίνειν,
‘' to warm,’ ‘ cheer.'

105. restant] ‘ Remain to complete the number of
four elements.' By iynis the bright ether is meant,
which is always to be distinguished from αέ-ν, the
atinosphere. Lucret. V. 498, ‘inde mare, inde' aer,
inde aether ignifer ipse.' Hence in 109, ‘ altum flam-
ma petit) Humboldt, Cosmos. vol. iii. p. 34 : ‘ As
the elements of the ancients signify not so much diver-
sity, or even simplicity or indecomposibility of sub-
stance as states ofmatter, the idea of the upper ether
(the fiery celestial atmosphere) had its root in the first
and normal antitheses of “ heavy '’ and “ light‚’'
“under ’' and “upper‚” “ earth ⁷' and “fire.” Be-
tween these two extremes are two “ middle elementary
states ;” water, more nearly akin to the heavy earth ;
and air, nearer to the light fire.' By this doctrine the
meaning of ‘ propior locus‚' sc. flammae, ‘ a'era cepit‚’
is made clear, Lucret. v. 458 ;7

‘ideo per rara foramma terrae

Partibus erumpens primus se sustulit aether
Igniscr, et multos secum levis abstulit ignes!

Hence the notion of Prometheus bringing fire from
heaven. The ether was the vast and inexhaustible
magazine of that commodicy, so essential to the life of
man.

107. ut semel—domos] ζ When once this mass fell
