to pieces through the strife of its parts, and dissolving,
went away into new dwellings.'

108. massa] This word, from μα’ζα a lump of
dough, implies something of which the component
parts are so thoroughly amalgainated that separation
is no longer possible. It is· often used of hot iron
(μύδρος), and Virgil> has ‘ atrae massam picis,’ Georg.
i. 275. It is well applied to the chaotic mass while its
parts, though separable, were intimately blended.

110. terra fretumque] WVhatever is meant by the
obscure expression in the Mosaic account of the crea-
tion, ‘ the waters were above the firma1nent,' We are
struck by its resemblance to the views of cosmogony
here given, principally, perhaps, from the lonic philo-
sophy. The solid earth settled down lowest, then the
sea : while the lighter elements remained alost,—like
strata of sediment from muddy water containing par-
ticles of different gravity.

112. redii] ‘i. q. «ivi. Compounds in rc are sre-
quently used for the silnples.' Kciqhtley. A more
satisfactory view is that of Mr. Long on Caesar. B. G.
iii. 17: ‘ revocare is not only to “recall,’' or “ with-
draw from a thing‚'' but to ‘⁶ draw a man into a new
or fresh direction,'' to a thing which is not his usual
or proper object.' See the note on vi. 5:35, infra,—It
has been already remarked (63) that J anus is the sun-
god. We here find him identified with the earth, or
rather universe, under his attribute of opener or
originator of created things. He associates his own
figure with that of the earth in rather a confused way.
