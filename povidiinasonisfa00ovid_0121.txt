NoTES. 95

is car, as in carriaye carrus, carruca, &c., and has no
connection with carpo (inf. 632).

621. honor eripitur] This was done by O. Oppius,
tribune of the people, among other sumptuary enact-
ments passed A. U. 538. Plutarch, Quaest. R. ξ 56.
-οῑεεύίηᾳύ, ‘ fixes‚' ‘determines 3' the true sense of the
word, Compare obstinatus, ‘ resolved against.'

627. Bina] i. e. ⁶ alterum pro pueris, alterum pro
puellis,’ (sc. pro partu felici). There is no allusion
to the two festivals of the same name (sup. 618).

629. Sem-tea] Varro, L. L. vii. ξ 84, ‘etiam nunc
dicimus scortea ea quae ex corio ac pellibus sunt facta;
inde in aliquot sacris ac sacellis scriptum habemus,

‘ N e quid scorteum adhibeatur,
ideo ne morticinum quid adsit)

He derives scortum, i. e. ‘ meretriX‚' from the same
word. The sacellum was near the Carmental gate—
ne violent, &c. They feared lest they should give
birth to dead children.

632. uon tibi nota] Here, as supra 129, words are
cited as obsolete except in sacrificial language. ‘ Car-
mentis ’ seems to have had two distinct attributes 3
that of a prophetess, from carmen, and that of aParca,
or Destiny, from carminare, ‘ to card wool‚' in allusion
to the fatal thread. Hence Plutarch, Quaest. Rom.
ξ 56, οἱ δὲ Μοῖραν ἡγοῦνται τήν Καρμένταν
εἶναι, καί διά τοῦτο Θύειν αὐτῇ τάς μητέρας. The
two words are probably in fact identica13 for there
was a common expression ‘ deducere carmen,' &07 ‘ to
spin a song ;’ and Mr, Long (on Cic, Cat, Maj. ξ 61)
