NOTES. 71

hypothetical event is assumed as prospectively realized‚
and a consequence deduced from it. There is a
slightly different usage.in iv. 487 3 v. 113. Merkel
gives, ‘Institerint imbres missi tibi nubibus atris:
Nonae signa dabunt‚’ effic, which is the reading of
most MSS„ with some minor variations. Yet the order
in the text seems far more probable in itself. lt was
the rain which gave signs of the N ones, not the Nones
of the rain, for sigma are visible marks. Siqua dabunt
may also mean ‘ ostendent se.’

319. succinctus minister] Compare iv. 413. We
have ‘succinti popae' in Propert. v. (iv.) 3. 62. Sue-
tonius says of Caligula, ξ 32; ‘Admota altaribus
victima, succinctus poparum habitu, elato alte malleo,
cultrarium mactavit.’ It thence appears that two per—
sons were employed to kill (at least the larger> victims,
one of whom felled the animal, the other cut the
throat. Ovid either speaks of one or the same minister
in ‘ quo feriente,' and ‘tincturus cultro& or ferire must
be understood of the blow of the knife (see iv. 415),
and cadit be taken for mactatur. Snecinctns refers to
the short apron worn round the loins of the popa.

322. Aqone ?] ‘Am I to strike 2’ Merkel edits
afflatae, a very inferior reading, but he has recalled
ayone, in his prefixae, from one of the best MSS. The
indicative is rather unusual, but may have been
adapted to the sound of the word. It is more likely
that it comes from (ἐγών, whether iu the sense of
‘agony’ or the more common one of ‘an assennl·ly‚’
