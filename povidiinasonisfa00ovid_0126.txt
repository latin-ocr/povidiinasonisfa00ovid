100 P. ovmn NAsoms FAsroRUM LIB. 1.

664. Cum vere] Fallow lands received their second
ploughing in spring. ”Eam πολεῖν, Hesiod. Op. et
D. 460.

665. suspendat] The ancient ploughs were very
light. In Spain, where so many Roman customs re-
main unaltered to this day, the Castilian often carries
the plough to the field on his shoulders.

666. reformidat] ‘ Shrinks from being stirred at all
in the winter.’ The first ploughing and sowing were
completed in late autumn in ordinary seasons. Virg.
Georg. i. 210, ‘ serite hordea campis Usque sub ex-
tremum brumae intractabilis imbrem! Hesiod. Op-
et D. 448, Soc. Speaking of the proper time for prun-
ing vines, Virgil says, ‘ ante reformidant ferrum,'·
Georg. ii. 369.

669. Fames] The question here arises, whether the
poet is speaking of the same feast as above, or the Pa-
ganalia. The words of Varro, ut sup„ evidently prove
nothing. Merkel’s view is given in these words (p.
clv.) ‘ Non de (liversis feriis intelligendum putaverim
Ovidium, sed de eisdem diverso modo in urbe et in
agris celebrandis?

670. paganis focis] Each pagus had a common altar
for the use of the inhabitants. The sacrifice was of a
propitiatory character, and as at the Palilia ⁴(iv. 735),
there was a lustratio, a ceremonial purifying or ‘ bless-
ing' of the fields and the people. To mother earth
especially a cake was offered of her own produce. The
nature of the Roman paqi will be best understood
from the account μοξ Dr. Arnold, Hist. of Rome, i. p.
