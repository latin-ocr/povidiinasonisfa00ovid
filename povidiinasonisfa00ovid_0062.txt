resulting from the mixed nature of the early Roman
population. It is difficult to explain the numerioal'
terms which we still employ, viZ. : September to De-
cember, except on the theory that, like the Greek
Prytanies, there were in actual use ten divisions of the
year. Instances have been adduced of treaties which
seem to have been reckoned by ten-month years,
such years amoun ting to 304 days each. But in the
case of the V eientian treaty, made with Rome in 280
for forty years, and either concluded or broken in
317, Dr. Arnold (Hist of Rome, i. p. 384) inclines to
the latter view against Niebuhr, who maintains that
the years were cyolio years of ten months 3 so that this
instance proves nothing. See also ibid. p. 388. One
thing at least seems certain, that the year must always
be regulated by, or more or less accurately adjusted
to, the recurrence of certain seasons, so as to be of the
samelength into whatever parts it is arbitrarily divided.
Hence ten lunar months could not possibly constitute
a year in themselves. If they were made up by inter-
calatfflg, it seems likely enough that the intercalated
days afterwards became two new months with regular
names like the rest, January taking the precedence of
all, because J anus was the god of opening (ii. 51). See
inf. on iii. 121, and the Dictionary of Antiquities, art.
calendar, where this intricate subjectis fully discussed.
