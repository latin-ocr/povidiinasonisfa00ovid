arietem immolat, dicti ab ayone, eo quod interrogatur
a principe civitatis, et princeps gregis immolatnr.'
This account is confused, if not corrupt 2 the question
was put to the Rex sacrificus, not by him3 and the
‘ princeps gregis ' introduces a totally different etymo-
logy, from ἄγειν or affere. Keightley explains strictos
cultros ‘grasped‚' ‘held in the hand) But strinycre,
cultrum 01· gladium is ‘to draw it‚’ properly ‘to strip
it ; ' for the verb implies the friction caused by passing
one thing over another. So ‘stringere glandes‚’ ‘to
strip off acorns‚' Georg. i. 305 ; ‘ stringere ripas,' said
of a river, Aen. viii. 63 3 of a weapon which grazes the
skin; Aen. ix. 377 ; of an idea which leaves an im-
pression on the mind, Aen. iv. 294.

325. Aynsclja] The argument is futile ; if this was
the true ancient name he would have to account for
the insertion of o in the latter form. Conversely‚ the
case might really have been so,

327. praet-isos ἱη aqua] Cf. Met. xv. 134 ; Victima—
percussa sanguine cultros Inficit in liquida praevisos
forsitan unda.' Animals have an instinctive presenti-
ment that they are going to be killed, which was
wrongly attributed to the reflection of the knife in the
vessel of lustral water which stood near the altar.—
mctw, ‘the aslony of frightss

331. Ayonia] The word is recorded by Festus,
‘hostiam antiqui Agoniam vocabant‚’ but not by
Varro. It does not sound like a genuine Italian term.

334. conj aye ovis] Like ‘ olentis uxores mariti,’ said
of goats, Hor. Od. i. 17. 7 2-Reae Sacrorum, inf. ii.
