No'ms. 85

507. neve manu] ‘ And hardly, hardly was she kept
by the hand of Evander, from leaping out in 1161· eager-
ness to stand upon the shore.'

509, 510. diist-cleos] She greets the indigenous gods
already there, and foretells the addition of others, such
as Vesta from Troy, and Romulus and the Caesars.

513. Este visi] The imperative is used, as not unn
frequently in the Greek tragedies‚ for the optative.
The sense, indeed, is nearly equivalent to salvete, fa.-
vete, 850.

517. olim] In the present tense, promittitur, futurity
is clearly implied. Not that olim, which is the vocative

of ole for ille, properly means anything more than
that time,⁷ where the speaker is supposed to point
either before 01· behind. It corresponds to ποτέ, and
often means ‘ some day,' aliqnando, as in Hor. Od. iv.
4. 5. On the prophecy see vi. 359. Virg. Aen.
viii. 340.

519. jam tanqam] ‘ J am’ 15 used even with a future
tense when an event 15 impending, and so already all
but realized, as Pers. ii. 50, ‘jam dabitur, jamjam.'
Aeneas arrived but a few years later than Evander.
Virgil describes their interview in Aen. viii.—femina,
Lavinia, the daughter of Latinus, who was sought in
marriage by both Turnus and Aeneas

521. funesta arma] Pallas, the 5011 of Evander, was
slain by Turnus, while fighting on the side of Aeneas,
but was avenged by the latter when he killed Turnus.
It 15 evident that in all this the poet had the Aeneid
in mind.
