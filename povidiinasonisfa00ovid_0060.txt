34 P. ovmn NASONIS msTomJM ΜΒ. 1.

Apollo need not surprise any one' acquainted with the
poetry of the Augustan age.

20. Clario deo] A ollo. From ΟῙῇωεςν-α-«ὴθηίᾈ
ionia, with a tempiejssfflfffdssafiono.

21. sensimus] ‘ We (the'Romans generally) are well
aware.' Keightley limits the sense too closely: ‘I
have heard of,' as Ovid was in exile—pro trepidis
reis. The Romans had a feeling, in which we do not
now share, that nothing was more honourable than
to devote time and talents to the defence of culpritS.
Gierig compares Hor. Od. ii. l. 13, where Pollio is
called ‘ insigne maestis praesidium reis.’ Like the
Greeks, they were very soft-hearted in this matter ;
but it arose from the unjust accusations, calumniae or
συκοφαντιάῖ, so often brought by the powerful
against the weak and defenceless, and was a natural
result of the j ealousies between plebs and populus—
tulit, sc. facundia tua.

23. ad nostras artes] Poetry as distinct from elo-
quence. Sueten. Calig. ξ 3, ‘ Omnes Germanico
corporis animique virtuteS, et quantas nemini cuiquam,
contigisse satis constat : formam et fortitudinem egre-
giam, ingenium in utroque eloquentiae doctrinaeque
genere praecellens—oravit causas etiam triumphalis ;
atque inter cetera studiorum monumenta reliquit et
comoedias Graecas‚’ In Epist. ex Pont. ii. 5. 49—56.
Ovid speaks of Germanicus's eloquence in exaggerated

terms :

‘ Mox ubi pulsa mora est, atque os eoeleste solutum,
Hoc Superos jures more solere loqui,' ὅτε.
