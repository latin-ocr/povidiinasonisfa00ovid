fallare cave, mind you do not forget the precept or miss
the count. Varro, L. L. vi. ξ 29, ‘ dies postridie
Calendas, Nonas, Idus, appellati atri quod per eos dies
novi inciperent‚' Plutarch, Quaest. Rom. ξ 25, in÷
quires why these three days in each month were
(13²²8'50302 uoci (ἕνεκδήμητοῑ (unfit for expeditions), and
after assigning the above as a probable reason, con—
cludes that they were regarded as sacred to the dead
and the powers called δαίμονες (genii, ii. 545), like
the second month after the commencement of the year.
He also suggests that they wished to leave the interval
of a whole day unemployed between a holiday and the
resumption of ordinary business, The day after the
kalends and nones was kept sacred, as Keightley re-
marks, on the analogy of the unlucky ides. The ‘ dies
Alliensis‚’ or defeat by the Gauls at the Allia, J uly 16,
390 Β. cn, is mentioned by Varro, vi. ξ 32. Compare
Ibis, 221, ‘ haec est in fastis cui dat gravis Allia no—
men.⁷ The belief in ‘black days' is very ancient.
Both Hesiod and Virgil treat of them ; and, like many
other ancient superstitious, it remains to this day in
the reluctance which sailors have to commence a
voyage on a Friday. A difficulty arises from the fact
that in the ancient calendars these days are generally
marked F (fasti) ; which Merkel (p. xxxiii.) removes,
or endeavours to remove, by the supposition that the
rule was relaxed *by Augustus, or that they were
publice reliyiosi, i. e, unlucky for public business,
though only marked as unfit for meetings of the Senate
and Comitia, which did not take place on dies fast-i.
