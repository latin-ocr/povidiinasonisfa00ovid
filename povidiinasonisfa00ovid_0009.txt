INTRODUCTION,

 

Publius Ovidius ,N aso was born at sufflo, in the
country of the Peligni, in central Italy, on the 20141101
March, 35:224& the year 111 which'the consuls, Hirtius
and Pansa were slain at the siege of Mutina (now Modena).
He studied rhetoric under Arellius Fuscus and Porcius
Latro, with the object of becoming a pleader3 but the
death of his elder brother Lucius rendered a division of
the family inheritance unnecessary‚ and Ovid was per-
mitted to indulge his taste for poetry. To complete his
education he repaired to Athens, where he acquired a
thoffirgh knowledge of Greek. Subsequeutly he travelled
in Asia„ Minor with his triend, the poet *Macen After his
return to Rome he was appointed one of the Triumviri
Capitale& and then a member of the court ot* 11100011-
tmnviri.

He married early, but soon divorced his wife. A second
marriage was dissolved in the same way ; but for his third
wife he seems 130 have had a deeper affection.

His early works were marked with gross licentiousness‚
and in A.D„„8, he was banis'hed from Rome by Augustus,
whose favour he had hitherto enjoyed, tho ostensible
reason of his banishment being the ill effect of one of his
works on public morals. The. :ir-‘gAmatoria, however,
had been published ten years before, and it is supposed
that there must have been some other motive, which,
however, has never come to light, though many guesses
have been made. The placo ot' his banishment was Tomi,
(masc. plur.) or, as 110 calls it biv-mels, Tomis, (fem. sing.)
in Thrace, 011 13110 west coast of the Pontus Euxinus.
Never did exile support his lot with less resignation ; and
his Tristia and Epi-stolae ecc Ponto are filled with com-
plaints against Tomis, and with the misci-ies which he
endured away from civilisation and his beloved Rome.
