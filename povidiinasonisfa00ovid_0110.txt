84 P. ovmn NASONIS FASTORUM LIB. 1.

495. tamen] See on 45, sup. The sense is, ‘nec
tempestas, quamquam saepe furit, 1010 tamen anno
horret? Compare Properb. ii. 4. 9 ;-

‘ Quippe ubi nee causas, nec apertos cemimus ictus,
Unde tamen veniant tot, mala, caeca via est ; '

and ib. 5. 5, ‘ inveniam tamen e multis fallacibus
unam‚' i.e. ‘quamvis pleraeque sint fallaces, tamen‚'
Sec. For the sentiment cf. Hor. Od. ii. 9. 1, ‘ non sem-
per imbres nubibus hispidos Manant in agros. Keight-
ley adds, Theocr. iv. 44, χω Zeia& α Mouet μεν πέλει
αἴθρῑος, chilon& δ’ ὑέῖ.

501. Tarenti] Very little is known of this place,
which seems 1ο have been a plot of low ground in 1116
Campus Martius, occasionally overflowed by 1116 river.
An altar of Dis existed on the spot, said to be con·
cealed‚ perhaps by the alluvial deposits. Marffial, i.
70, 2, writes ‘Tarentos‚’ as also in iv. 1. 8, according
to 1116 best MSS„ but ‘ 'ferento' in x. 63. 3. Varro, in
a corrupt passage, L. L. vi. ξ 24, mentions Tarentum in
connection with certain sacrifices to the Dii Manes.
Merkel (p. cxlvii.) quotes Servius on Aen. viii. 63,
‘(Tiberis‚) in aliqua etiam urbis parte Tarentum dicitur,
eo quod ripas terat?

504. Constituit manum] As if 1ο stop the ship, or
bring it ashore‚ in her eagerness to land. The pro-
phecy of Carmentis is a fine and wild strain ε and like
that of Anchises at 1116 close of Aen. vi., is ingeniously
turned into a glorification of the reigning emperor.

505 dextram] To one ascending the river, Rome
was on the right bank. See sup. on 241.—pinea texta,
the deck, or perhaps generally for navim.
