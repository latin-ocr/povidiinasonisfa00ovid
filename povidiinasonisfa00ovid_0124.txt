The words of Suetonius, as Merkel observes, p. cclxii„
might lead one to suppose that the dedication di'd not-
take place till 7 65, when he triumphed for the Panno-
nian conquest—triampliatae yentiS, the same authority
states, are the Sigambri, though the participle must
not be taken literally, but simply for victae. The
words of Suetonius, ‘ de manubiis,' ὅσα, seem clearly
to refer to the same circumstance—passos crines porr-iyit,
whatever be the exact meaning, refers also to the defeat
of the Sigambri in 747. Gierig quotes Amor. i. 14. 45 :

‘ J am tibi captivos mittet Germania crines:
Culta triumphat-ae munere gentis erss,'

which inclines Keightley to take the present passage
literally, as implying an annual tribute of flaxen hair,

of which the Romans were very fond. But passi
crines were a sign of woe often attributed to captives ;
and the poet probably means that the women held
out their long streaming looks to excite compassion
in the conqueror. Compare Trist. iv. 2. 43. Merkel
edits corrigit, which he thinks can mean ‘desecat ;’
but this is rightly rejected by Keightley.—ducc vener-
ande, i.e. Tiberius, now Emperor.

647. libasti] See on 587.—quam colis, sc, ‘ you set the
example of Concord in your own family and conduct.'

649. tua Genitrix] Livia, wife of Augustus—rehus
et, ανα. These words are obscure. Keightley under-
stands by res, ‘ property ;’ Gierig says, ‘concordiam
rebus ipsis Augusto exhibuit? He seems to mean that
both Tiberius and Livia patronized Ooncord in two
