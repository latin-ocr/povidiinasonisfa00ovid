NOTEs. 65

was called ‘ a J anus ς’ but in one place only was there
a statue of the god, viz, in the temple between the
Forum Romanum and Forum J ulium. But even this,
properly speaking, was not so much a temple as a
portico or grand gateway, affording communication
between the two. Hence Varro, L. L. V. ξ 165 : ‘ J anu-
alis (porta) dicta a J ano: et ideo ibi positum Jani
signum et jus institutum a Pompilio, ut scribit in
Annalibus Piso, ut sit aperta semper, nisi quoni bellum
sit nusquam? To this statue Virgil alludes, Aen. vii.
610 : ‘nec eustos absistit limine J anus.' When ‘che
great gates were closed, it is probable that a wieket or
side-door allowed ‘ohe people to pass through. It was
known as the temple of Janus Bifrons or Geminus,
and was built by Numa (Livy, i. 19) ‘ ad infimum
Argiletum,’ i. e. the part between the southern horn
of the Quirinal and the Forum Romanum, or, in the
other direction, be'cween the Capitol and the Subura.
This musb be distinguished from the temple of Dui-
lius, supra 223. Merkel, p. cclxiii: ‘ Probabile est
Ovidium, euni primum Ver. 257 scriberet, unuln tantum
J ani sacellum, sive templum, inter duo fora novisse,
et ver. 277 ad hoe retulisse veterum ritum claudendi
et aperiendi,prout etiam, paulo aliter fortasse, i. e. feeit.
Varro, 5. 1653 He appears to consider the temple
buil'c by Numa as the same spoken of in ii. 201, and
distinct from this ; whereas Keightley (Excursus i. p.
226) identifies them. Mr. Maeleane 011 Hor. p. 496
(school edition), seems to agree with Merkel. The
subject is full of doubts and difficulties;
