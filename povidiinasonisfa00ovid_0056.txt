NOTES.

 

1. Tempora] Under this general term the poet in-
cludes not only the months and their divisions, but the
different kinds of days, festivals, half-holidays and
those for ordinary business. Causae are the reasons or
grounds on which the distinctions were established.
lt is probable that the word has reference to the Αἴτια
of Callimachus, a lost epic poem, explanatory of the
ancient Greek legends whence Propertius avowedly bor-
rowed the idea which Ovid has anre fully developed
in his Fasti. The last book of Propertius, contain-
ing some portions of a metrical history of Rome, is
clearly the model on which our poet composed the
present work. In Prop. v. (iv.) 10. 1, we have ‘ nunc
Jovis incipiam causas aperire Feretri.'—siyna. This
implies that astronomical observations will be inter-
woven with the historica] narratives (inf. 295), so that
the work may be at once useful and amusing. This
part of the poet’s information, which >is occasionally
inaccuratc, was derived froin a contemporary gram-
marian and friend, Clodius Tuscus. He is mentioned
as Tuscus in Epist. ex Pont. iv. 16. 20 ; and an account
of his treatise on the risings and settings of the stam,
a Greek translation of which was first published in
1823, is given by .Merkel, Praef. p. lxvi. seqq. A
