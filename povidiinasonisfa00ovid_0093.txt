interfere directly with the designs of another, though
he might thwart them. ——cum means ‘with.’ Arnold,
Hist. R. i. p. 9. gives the legend thus: ‘As the
Sabines were rushing in, behold there burst forth
from the temple os J anus, which was near the gate‚
a mighty stream of water, and it swept away the
Sabines, and saved the city. For this it was ordered
that the temple of J anus should stand ever open in
time of war, that the god might be ever ready, as on
this day, to go out and give his aid to the people of
Romulus.' From this event the temple or gateway
was called Lautolae. Varro, L.L. V. ξ 156: ‘Lautolcae
a lavando, quod ibi ad J anum Geminum aquae caldae
fuerunt.' Nor need. we doubt that some truth lies
at the bottom of this story, as in that of the Lacus
Curtius, vi. 403, for the site and neighbourhood of
Rome are volcanic, and ancient outbreaks of this kind
might have been speculated on apart from history or
tradition. See Humboldt, Aspects of Nature, ii. p.
219. ——mecae artis, sc. that of opening.

273. cujus—loco est] ‘ then, after the repulse of the
Sabines, the good quality of this was perceived, the
form, which it had, was restored, to the place [now]
secure.’ *Another reading is qsacwque fait.

274. tuto loco] i.e., a me servato. The meaning is
not quite plain : ‘ The site was afterwards left clear
and unoccupied, and a temple and altar erected to my
honour ;’ i.e., the buildings were removed that it might
be consecrated to me.
